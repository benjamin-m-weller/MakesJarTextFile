# MakesJarTextFile
Personal Utility Porgram. I wrote this one file program to make the "txt" file required for compiling and creating a JAR file. It takes the file location of project as the first argument and the name of the main class as the second.
This project was very useful during my time on Windows, but is trivial to accomplish in Linux.
